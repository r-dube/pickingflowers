# Communication products in Lithuania
For several years, Telecom service providers have used Huawei equipment in their networks. 
However, in 2019, the Lithuanian government implicated China in espionage operations in Lithuania.
Further, the Lithuanian government accused Huawei of assisting China's espionage.
Subsequently, Lithuania banned Huawei from 5G networks in Lithuania and asked its citizens to refrain from using Huawei phones.

## 4G network
Lithuania has three mobile operators: Tele2, Telia and Bite \[1\].
As per \[2\], all three mobiles operators had exclusively installed telecom equipment from China during their 4G network buildout.

## Huawei banned from 5G infrastructure
In 2019, the Lithuanian government's "National Threat Assessment" highlighted Chinese espionage activity in Lithuania \[3\].
This assessment stated that China's intelligence "...  utilises state-funded Confucius Institutes, Chinese companies and news agencies, use Chinese students studying abroad."
Further, the assessment indicated that "Chinese intelligence may seek to obtain sensitive or classified national or NATO and EU information." from Lithuanian citizens.
Finally, the assessment described how Chinese intelligence operatives co-opt Lithuanian citizens in political decision-making roles: "They seek to influence such individuals by giving gifts, paying for trips to China, covering expenses of training and courses organized there."

Separate from the national threat assessment, a Lithuanian government official indicated that Lithuania was in the process of assessing Huawei's role in aiding Chinese espionage \[4\].
While the results of the government's analysis of Huawei have not been made public, the Lithuanian parliament effectively banned Huawei from its (future) 5G network \[5\].
Telecom operators are also required to replace deployed equipment from banned vendors (including Huwawei) by 2025.
