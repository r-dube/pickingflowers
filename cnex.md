# Huawei uses an academician to steal from a startup
In 2013, Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.'s storage division percieved that it was falling behind other vendors' storage technology.
One such vendor was CNEX Labs, Inc.
Huawei attempted to catch up by employing two technniques to acquire CNEX's technology.
First, Huawei's management tricked CNEX into disclosing some of its technology by pretending that a business deal for CNEX was on the table.
Second, and simultaneously, they commissioned an academician to illegally obtain and reverse-engineer CNEX's technology.

## Background on CNEX
CNEX, headquartered in California, was stated in 2013 to developer controllers for solid state drives (SSDs).
One of its co-founders, Yiren Huang, had worked on such controllers and related technology areas for several years.
This co-founder also worked at Huawei from 2011 to 2013 in Huawei's storage division.
By 2016, CNEX had developed some advanced controllers for SSDs - technology that Huawei did not yet have.

## Huawei strings along CNEX
Huawei engaged CNEX by pretending that it was interested in purchasing CNEX's technology.
In 2015, Huawei invited CNEX to make a presentation in China.
Huawei portrayed this presentation as "for the headquarter and not for the storage group."
Subsequently, Huawei pressured CNEX to share a copy of the deck - the pressure came from dangling the possibility of a purchase in front of CNEX.
Huawei assured CNEX that it would not share the presentation with the storage group.
However, once it had the presentation, it did just that.
The idea was to understand bits of technology documented in the presentation and use those ideas in Huawei's storage group.

## Huawei employs China-based academic for reverse-engineering
In 2016, Huawei engaged two academicians to reverse-engineer CNEX's product.
One academician was based at the University of Texas in Arlington.
The other academican - Bo Mao - was based at Xiamen University in China.

Huawei gave the academcian in Texas a grant to procure equipment from CNEX.
The academician initiated contact with CNEX but did not follow through.
However, a different academician at the same university purchased two controllers from CNEX. 

Huawei cut a separate deal with Bo Mao to create a project to reverse engineer CNEX's technology.
Huawei paid Mao for this work and maintained frequent and sustained communication with Mao regarding the project.

## Destabalizing CNEX
Huawei took some additional steps to destabilize CNEX.
It created an organizational chart representation of CNEX, enumerating CNEX employees, their locations and their compensation.
Then it launched an effort to hire away these employees from CNEX for the purpose of creating turmoil within CNEX.
