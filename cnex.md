# Huawei uses an academician to steal from a startup
In 2013, Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.'s storage division percieved that it was falling behind other vendors' storage technology.
One such vendor was CNEX Labs, Inc.
Huawei attempted to catch up by employing two technniques to acquire CNEX's technology.
First, Huawei's management tricked CNEX into disclosing some of its technology by pretending that a business deal for CNEX was on the table.
Second, and simultaneously, they commissioned an academician to illegally reverse-engineer CNEX's technology.

## Background on CNEX
CNEX, headquartered in California, was stated in 2013 to developer controllers for solid state drives (SSDs).
One of its co-founders, Yiren Huang, had worked on such controllers and related technology areas for several years.
This co-founder also worked at Huawei from 2011 to 2013 in Huawei's storage division.
By 2016, CNEX had developed some advanced controllers for SSDs - technology that Huawei did not yet have.
