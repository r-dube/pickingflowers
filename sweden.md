# Exploiting Sweden's legal system
As in many functioning democracies, Sweden separates its legislative, judicial and executive branches of government.
Following a 2019 law that allows a security-based exclusion of vendors from Swedish national infrastructure, Sweden's telecom regulator barred Huawei from Sweden's 5G network.
Exploiting Sweden's separation of the branches of government, Huawei is using the legal system to preserve its operations in Sweden.

## Gui Minhai and Sweden-China governmental relations
Starting around 2015 Sweden-China governmental relations had been on a down swing.
These relationships deteriorated when Chinese agents kidnapped Gui Minhai - a naturalized Swedish Citizen - in Thailand and forced him to confess to vague crimes in mainland China.

Gui was born in mainland China and obtained Swedish citizenship after the Tiananmen Square massacre.
In the process Gui renounced his Chinese citizenship.
Subsequently, Gui set up a bookshop in Hong Kong with four other partners.
He also published several books on characters in the Communist Party of China (CCP).
Over time, all five of the partners in the bookshop were arrested and charged with (seemingly) made up crimes.

Since Gui's kidnapping, Swedish officials have been advocating on his behalf to the Chinese government with little success.
For most of the time since the kidnapping, he has been detained, denied access to a lawyer and not allowed to meet the Swedish consular officials in China.
Since the kudiciary in China is not independent of the legislative or executive branches of government, there is no mechanism internal to the Chinese government that would bring him to a fair trial or secure his release.

As a result of the coverage of the affair in Sweden, Swedish public opinion of China has declined and governmental relations have become strained.

## 2019 electronic communications law
In 2019, Sweden adopted an electronic communications law that enabled the country to exclude vendors from national infrastructure based on security considerations.
This law came into effect on January 1, 2020.
The law gave the Swedish Armed Forces and Swedish Intelligence (Sapo) a say in the selection of vendors for 5G infrastructure.

While the law was likely inspired by concerns about Huawei in other democratic countries (most notable in the U.S. and Australia), China's poor relationship with Sweden was likely a factor as well.

## Huawei Ban
In October 2020, the Swedish Post and Telecom Authority - the telecom regulator - barred Huawei and ZTE from participating in Sweden's 5G infrastructure.
The ban was based on the 2019 law and on the recommendation of the Swedish Armed Forces and Sapo.

Sapo's stance on Huawei was unsurprising.
Sapo had long highlighted Chinese espionage activities in Sweden.

## Huawei's use of Sweden's legal system
In November 2020, immediately after the telecom regulator's decision, Huawei filed a complaint with a Swedish court in an effort to overturn the regulator's decision.
The complaint prevented the regulator from proceeding with a 5G spectrum auction to telecom operators - an early step in the process of deploying 5G infrastructure.

The court ultimately allowed the auction to continue but also allowed Huawei to continue the legal process.
However, in January 2021, the court upheld the regulators ban from the 5G network.

In April 2021, Huawei filed additional papers to continue its use of the legal system in Sweden to preseve its market position.
In June of the same year, the court again upheld the regulators ban.

In October 2021, Huawei filed yet another appeal against its ban.
This appeal is pending review at the time of this writing.

## Impact on Ericsson's business in China
Ericsson is a Sweden headquartered telecom equipment vendor that competes directly with Huawei and ZTE.
Two other telecom endors, Nokia (headquartered in Finland) and Samsung (headquartered in South Korea), make up the remaining well-known vendors for 5G infrastructure.
All three of Ericsson, Nokia and Samsung are headquartered in democratic countries.
While they have to adhere to national laws imposed by their respective governments, they also have the freedom to challenge governmental actions in the courts or in the press.

In China, the telecom companies building out 5G networks are state directed.
Companies such as China Mobile do not operate independently and hand out market share to competing companies, partially based on the Chinese government's direction.
The market shares allocated to various companies are not subject to independent regulator review and cannot be challenged via an independent judiciary.

In 2020, China Mobile allocated Ericsson an 11% share of its 5G equipment spend. 
However, following the ban on Huawei in Sweden, a 2021 buildout allocated 2% of spend to Ericsson.
Finally, another buildout initiated in October 2021 allocated 0% to Ericsson.

Another 5G network being jointly built by China Telecom and China Unicom shows a similar trajectory.
Ericsson was allocated 3% of the spend in Phase 2 buildout.

## Ericsson's defense of Huawei
Ericsson's CEO has come to Huawei's defense and urged the Swedish government not to ban Huawei in Sweden's 5G network.
Ericsson's defense of Huawei is based purely on its own interest of preserving market access in China.
In his defense of Huawei, Ericsson's CEO does not provide a method for Sweden to safeguard national infrastructure.
Nor does Ericsson's CEO address the asymmetry in the application of rules and laws - Huawei can and does openly challenge the Swedish regulator's ban but Ericsson has no opportunity to challenge the market share handed out by China Mobile at the Chinese government's direction.

In similar vein, Ericsson has stayed silent when other democratic countries such as the U.K. and the U.S. banned Huawei and ZTE - Ericsson stood to gain from those bans as the bans increased Ericsson's odds of being selected for the 5G buildout in those countries.
Only when Sweden banned the two Chinese companies did Ericsson speak out to attempt to preserve its revenue in China.
