# Exploiting Sweden's legal system
As in many functioning democracies, Sweden separates its legislative, judicial and executive branches of government.
Following a 2019 law that allows a security-based exclusion of vendors from Swedish national infrastructure, Sweden's telecom regulator barred Huawei from Sweden's 5G network.
Exploiting Sweden's separation of the branches of government, Huawei is using the legal system to preserve its penetration of Telecom operators in Sweden.

## Gui Minhai and Sweden-China governmental relations
Starting around 2015 Sweden-China governmental relations had been on a down swing.
These relationships deteriorated when Chinese agents kidnapped Gui Minhai - a naturalized Swedish Citizen - in Thailand and forced him to confess to vague crimes in mainland China.

Gui was born in mainland China and obtained Swedish citizenship after the Tiananmen Square massacre.
In the process Gui renounced his Chinese citizenship.
Subsequently, Gui set up a bookshop in Hong Kong with four other partners.
He also published several books on characters in the Communist Party of China (CCP).
Over time, all five of the partners in the bookshop were arrested and charged with (seemingly) made up crimes.

Since Gui's kidnapping, Swedish officials have been advocating on his behalf to the Chinese government with little success.
For most of the time since the kidnapping, he has been detained, denied access to a lawyer and not allowed to meet the Swedish consular officials in China.
Since the kudiciary in China is not independent of the legislative or executive branches of government, there is no mechanism internal to the Chinese government that would bring him to a fair trial or secure his release.

As a result of the coverage of the affair in Sweden, Swedish public opinion of China has declined and governmental relations have become strained.

## 2019 electronic communications law
In 2019, Sweden adopted an electronic communications law that enabled the country to exclude vendors from national infrastructure based on security considerations.
This law came into effect on January 1, 2020.
The law gave the Swedish Armed Forces and Swedish Intelligence (Sapo) a say in the selection of vendors for 5G infrastructure.

While the law was likely inspired by concerns about Huawei in other democratic countries (most notable in the U.S. and Australia), China's poor relationship with Sweden was likely a factor as well.

## Huawei Ban
In October 2020, the Swedish Post and Telecom Authority - the telecom regulator - barred Huawei and ZTE from participating in Sweden's 5G infrastructure.
The ban was based on the 2019 law and on the recommendation of the Swedish Armed Forces and Sapo.

Sapo's stance on Huawei was unsurprising.
Sapo had long highlighted Chinese espionage activities in Sweden.

## Huawei's use of Sweden's legal system
In November 2020, immediately after the telecom regulator's decision, Huawei filed a complaint with a Swedish court in an effort to overturn the regulator's decision.
The appeal prevented the regulator from proceeding with a 5G spectrum auction to telecom operators - an early step in the process of deploying 5G infrastructure.
