# "Elite Capture" at Canadian universities
Academicians at Canadian universities, like academecians anywhere else, need funding to build and maintain research groups and publish research papers for career advancement.
Conflicts arise when the funding is provided by a state directed company of a foreign autocratic state.
Academicians that take funding from such a company, wittingly or unwittingly become "captured" by the stated direct company.
Over time these academicians become available to speak on the behalf of the foreign state and the state directed company.

This process of decision makers becoming obligated to a foreign state or the foreign state's proxies is called "elite capture".
In the case of Canada, academicians at several universities appear to be in the process of being captured by Huawei.

## Feed-Capture-Use
The general process of elite capture as used by China follows a feed-capture-use pattern.
First, an agent working on behalf of the Chinese government supplies the target with resources that they want or need.
Examples include all expenses paid trips to China, job offers, consulting contracts and business deals.
Second, the agent makes the target dependent on China some way. 
For example, the agent may provide continued facilitation to progress a business deal or assist the target in maintaining a job or a consulting arrangement.
Finally, the agent calls in a favor from the target.
Examples include speaking in favor of the Chinese government or its policies in a public forum, writing a favorable editorial (opinion) column, giving media outliets China-favorable interviews and providing access to privileged resources under the control of the target.

\[1\] describes Huawei's attempt to recruit a computer science (artificial intelligence) academician that follows the above mentioned template.
Huawei first attempted to recruit the academician into a research project in China with lax privacy and data protection guidelines.
When the academician declined, Huawei's subsidiary in Canada offered to hire the academician as a consultant at three times his university salary.
Huawei Canada also offered to provide research grants and allow the academician to maintain his job at the university.

The academician sensed that taking the Huawei offer would make him dependent on Huawei.
Once he accepted the funds and hired PhD students to conduct research, the academician would be beholden to Huawei for continued research funding for his PhD students.
Such "capture" would reduce the academician's ability to steer his research away from ethically problematic data or to speak out against Huawei in case of an ethics violation.

The academician declined Huawei's offer to prevent himself from being captured.

## Canadian universities as a target
As of this writing, Canada, unlike the U.S. and Australia, lacks laws to identify the extent of Chinese operations in Canada.
Even though Canadian intelligence services have been warning the Canadian goverment of escalating Chinese operations in Canada, the Canadian government has not reponded with new laws or regulations.
It is possible, that the non-response is partly due to "elite capture" among the lawmakers \[2\].

Separately, Canadian intelligence services have highlighted Chinese operations on Canadian universities \[3\].
