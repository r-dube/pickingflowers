# "Elite Capture" at Canadian universities
Academicians at Canadian universities, like academecians anywhere else, need funding to build and maintain research groups and publish research papers for career advancement.
Conflicts arise when the funding is provided by a state directed company of a foreign autocratic state.
Academicians that take funding from such a company, wittingly or unwittingly become "captured" by the stated direct company.
Over time these academicians become available to speak on the behalf of the foreign state and the state directed company.

This process of decision makers becoming obligated to a foreign state or the foreign state's proxies is called "elite capture".
In the case of Canada, academicians at several universities appear to be in the process of being captured by Huawei.

## Feed-Capture-Use
The general process of elite capture as used by China follows a feed-capture-use pattern.
First, an agent working on behalf of the Chinese government supplies the target with resources that they want or need.
Examples include all expenses paid trips to China, job offers, consulting contracts and business deals.
Second, the agent makes the target dependent on China some way. 
For example, the agent may provide continued facilitation to progress a business deal or assist the target in maintaining a job or a consulting arrangement.
Finally, the agent calls in a favor from the target.
Examples include speaking in favor of the Chinese government or its policies in a public forum, writing a favorable editorial (opinion) column, giving media outliets China-favorable interviews and providing access to privileged resources under the control of the target.

\[1\] describes Huawei's attempt to recruit a computer science (artificial intelligence) academician that follows the above mentioned template.
Huawei first attempted to recruit the academician into a research project in China with lax privacy and data protection guidelines.
When the academician declined, Huawei's subsidiary in Canada offered to hire the academician as a consultant at three times his university salary.
Huawei Canada also offered to provide research grants and allow the academician to maintain his job at the university.

The academician sensed that taking the Huawei offer would make him dependent on Huawei.
Once he accepted the funds and hired PhD students to conduct research, the academician would be beholden to Huawei for continued research funding for his PhD students.
Such "capture" would reduce the academician's ability to steer his research away from ethically problematic data or to speak out against Huawei in case of an ethics violation.

The academician declined Huawei's offer to prevent himself from being captured.

## Canadian universities as a target
As of this writing, Canada, unlike the U.S. and Australia, lacks laws to identify the extent of Chinese operations in Canada.
Even though Canadian intelligence services have been warning the Canadian goverment of escalating Chinese operations in Canada, the Canadian government has not reponded with new laws or regulations.
It is possible, that the non-response is partly due to "elite capture" among the lawmakers \[2\].

Separately, Canadian intelligence services have highlighted Chinese operations on Canadian universities \[3\].
Unfortunately, the Canadian government has not yet issued guidelines to Canadian universities on funding from foreign sources \[4\].

## Huawei feeds research funding to Canadian universities
\[4\] lists 17 Canadian universities that have taken research funding from Huawei.
This list includes the top-10 Candian computer science research programs \[5\].
As of 2019, Huawei had funnelled more than 56 million Canadian dollars to these 17 programs \[6\].

## Academicians captured by Huawei
The list of universities that received Huawei's research funds include the University of Waterloo, the University of British Columbia and the University of Toronto.
Public statements from these universities touting their research funds from Huawei point to an element of "capture" \[7\], \[8\], \[9\].

Since the Canadian government hasn't clearly specified the boundaries of foreign research, semi-autonmous agencies of the Canadian government amplify Huawei's influence by matching Huawei's research funding with Canadian government funding \[10\], \[11\].

## Captured British Columbia academician on Huawei
We reproduce a University of British Columbia academician's remarks to a Chinese state directed news outlet below.
The academician in question received research funding from Huawei.
The academcian's remarks provide an example of the "use" to Huawei of a "capture" \[12\], \[13\], \[14\].

First the academician complains that the U.S. government disallows mixing U.S. technology with research funded bu Huawei:
*“Last summer the US imposed restrictions on who is able to work, and under what circumstances, with Huawei … so now we have restrictions where we can’t use US technology in the research we do with Huawei.”* 

In the process ignoring U.S. interests:
*"Intellectual property generated by the research will be owned jointly by Huawei and UBC, although the university is not allowed to sell the technology to Huawei’s rivals for a window of several years."*

Second, the academcian propagates a Huawei assertion that there is a distinction between a Huawei subsidiary in Canada and the company's base in China with respect to data and intellectural property:
*"The funding comes from Huawei Canada, not Huawei China. That’s an important distinction because Huawei Canada operates under the laws of Canada. Any time we share information they have to ask us if it’s OK to share it with China. The information stays in Canada unless we agree to have it exported.”*
Independent researchers and government agencies have documented multiple cases where Huawei subsidiaries outside of China have acted on behalf of the parent company in stealing intellectual property.

Third, the academician repeats Huawei's assurance (not an independent study or reports from Canadian intelligence) that Huawei does not steal:
*“I have been given assurances [by Huawei] that Huawei is not stealing information and data from Canadian users. I don’t have any reason to doubt that.”*

It is unclear if the academician fully understannds that he has been captured by Huawei and is being used.
Regardless, the propaganda value of the academician's statements to Huawei and the Chinese government is clear.
