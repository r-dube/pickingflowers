# "Elite Capture" at Canadian universities
Academicians at Canadian universities, like academecians anywhere else, need funding to build and maintain research groups and publish research papers for career advancement.
Conflicts arise when the funding is provided by a state directed company of a foreign autocratic state.
Academicians that take funding from such a company, wittingly or unwittingly become "captured" by the stated direct company.
Over time these academicians become available to speak on the behalf of the foreign state and the state directed company.

This process of decision makers becoming obligated to a foreign state or the foreign state's proxies is called "elite capture".
In the case of Canada, academicians at several universities appear to be in the process of being captured by Huawei.
