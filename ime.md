# Death of a research scientist on the eve of a Huawei project
In 2012, Shane Todd - an electrical engineer and research scientist - worked on a project proposal targetted at Huawei. 
The project involved obtaining dual military/civilian use technology for the Institute of Microelectronics (IME) in Singapore from a U.S. based company.
Shane felt uncomfortable with his role in acquiring this dual-use technology.
Partly as a result of this discomfort, Shane decided to leave his job and return to his home country - the U.S.
On the eve of his departure from Singapore, Shane was found dead in his apartment.

## IME
IME is a semiconductor research insititute funded by an agency of the government of Singapore \[1\].
IME functions as a bridge between academia and the industry.
As part of its mission, IME employs researchers and takes on research projects from commercial corporations that create or use semiconductors.
In 2021, IME runs its own cleanrooms and fabs.

## Huawei's relationship with IME
By 2012, IME had successfully conducted multiple projects for Huawei.
During 2012, Shane was actively involved in a new IME project proposal for Huawei \[2\], \[3\].

## Acquiring Gallium Nitride technology
The IME-Huawei project proposal involved dual-use (military/civilian) Gallium Nitride equipment for semiconductor development from U.S. based Veeco \[4\].
Shane had previously travelled to the U.S. on behalf of IME to be trained on Veeco's equipment.
Were the Huawei project to go ahead, the Veeco equipment would have to be used for the project.
In January 2012, IME had acquired Veeco equipment under a U.S. export license that prohibited the use of the equipment for military applications \[3\].

## Pressure perceived by Shane
Shane perceived the use of Veeco's equipment for the Huawei project as beyond the limits imposed by the U.S. export license \[5\].
Shane believed that by engaging in the Huawei project he was working against the U.S. and may be breaking U.S. law.
He expressed his anxious to his family back in the U.S. and appeared to be fearful for his life.

Even outside of the Huawei project, Shane was dissatisfied with his work and life at IME. 
He decided to leave IME and return to the U.S.

## Shane's death
In March 2012, Shane gave notice to IME to leave the insititute.
Shortly thereafter, Shane purchased a plane ticket for the U.S. - he planned to leave Singapore on July 1.

By June 22, 2012 Shane had wrapped up his work with IME.
He had had a farewell get-together with his colleagues and was in the process of cleaning out his apartment.

On June 24, 2012, Shane was discovered hanging in his apartment.
He was dead when by the time he was found.
A subsequent coroner's report indicated that he died on the night of June 22 \[2\], \[3\], \[5\].
