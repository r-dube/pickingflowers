# Huawei misinformation in New Zealand
New Zealand disallowed the use of Huawei equipment in 5G networks back in 2018.
Immediately after the ban, Huawei executives atttempted to pressure the New Zealand Government and spread misinformation about its competitors.
Pragmatism forced the mobile operators in New Zealand to select 5G vendors other than Huawei.
Those that did so quickly are well on their way to a country-wide 5G network.

## Mobile operators in New Zealand
There are three major mobile operators in New Zealand: Vodafone NZ, Spark and 2degrees \[Statista2022\], \[Wikipedia2022\]. 

Vodafone has traditionally used wireless equipment from Nokia, including for its 4G network. 
Spark and 2degrees have traditionally used Huawei wireless equipment \[NZHerald2021\], \[YouTube2019\].

2degrees' market share is smaller than the other two operators. 
In addition, 2degrees is owned by a private equity company and used vendor financing from Huawei to build its 3G/4G network \[NZHerald2021\].

## Huawei's claims
In \[YouTube2019\], Huawei's deputy CEO for New Zealand - Andrew Bowater - makes several claims regarding Huawei and its direct competitors.
We document these claims below fact-check them against publicly available documentation.

### Ownership
Huawei statement: "We are ... 100% owned by our own staff."

Huawei has an opaque ownership structure.
Most of Huawei's own personnel are not fully aware of their employer's ownership structure \[PF2\], \[PF3\].

### Record of wrongdoing
Huawei statement: "GCHQ has never never found any evidence of deliberate wrongdoing by Huawei nor any state inteference from China or any suggestion of counter-espionage..."

While GCHQ may not have found evidence of deliberate wrongdoing, there is other publicly available evidence of wrongdoing by Huawei executives, managers and engineers \[PF1\], \[PF2\].

### Competitor's R&D
Huawei statement: "... [Nokia, Ericsson] manufacture and do their product development in China like us, the key difference being that their headquarters are in Europe"

Nokia and Ericsson are not just headquartered in Europe - unlike Huawei, they do most of their research and development outside of China and outside the direct influence of the CCP \[PF3\].

### American companies
Huawei statement: "America no longer had any skin in the [wireless telecom] market... Nortel, Sun and the other competitors .... had all disappeared..."

Nortel was a Canadian (not U.S.) company.
CCP directed operations accelerated Nortel's demise \[PF4\].

Sun was never a wireless equipment vendor.
It was acquired by and is now integrated into Oracle \[Wikipedia2022-2\].

## Lessons from New Zealand's experience with 5G
In November 2018, after the denials of its 5G application that included the projected use of Huawei equipment, Spark publicly objected to GCSB's decision.
However, after Vodafone - that did not rely on Huawei for its 3G/4G network - made a decision to deploy Nokia equipment, Spark moved on from its objections and selected an Nokia \[NZHerald2018\].

By the fourth quarter of 2021, all three of Vodafone, Spark and 2degrees seem to have accepted GCSB's decision on Huawei.
Vodafone and Spark have rolled out 5G in New Zealand and their networks' performance appears to be satisfactory to customers \[OpenSignal2021\].

2degrees has not fully rolled out a 5G network (as of January 2022) - partially due to financial constraints, including previous reliance on Huawei vendor financing.
