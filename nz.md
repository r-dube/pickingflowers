# Huawei misinformation in New Zealand

## Andrew Bowater's claims regarding Huwaei

### Statements
"We are ... 100% owned by our own staff."

"GCHQ has never never found any evidence of deliberate wrong doing by Huawei nor any state inteference from China or any suggestion of counter-espionage..."

"... everything we do in the UK and New Zealand apart looking at all source code and nothing has been found"

"... [Nokia, Ericsson] manufacture and do their product development in China like us, the key difference being that their headquarters are in Europe"

"... The core is critical and it's only through the core that you could manipulate a network..."

"America no longer had any skin in the [wireless telecom] market... Nortel, Sun and the other competitors .... had all disappeared..."
