# Huawei misinformation in New Zealand

## Mobile operators in New Zealand
There are three major mobile operators in New Zealand: Vodafone NZ, Spark and 2degrees \[Statista2022\], \[Wikipedia2022\]. 

Vodafone has has traditionally used wireless equipment from Nokia, including for its 4G network. Spark and 2degrees have traditionally used Huawei wireless equipment \[NZHerald2021\], \[YouTube2019\].

2degrees' market share is smaller than the other two operators. 
In addition, 2degrees is owned by a private equity company and used vendor financing from Huawei to build its 3G/4G network.

### 5G timeline
- March 19, 2018: Spark conducts first 5G trial in New Zeland. Huawei wireless equipment is used \[Stuff2018\].
- November 27, 2018: Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB) denies Spark's application to use Huawei equipment in its 5G network. GCSB uses the 2013 Telecommunications Interception Capability and Security (TICSA) act in denying Spark's application \[NZHerald2018\].
- May 6, 2019: Andrew Bowater, Deputy CEO Huawei NZ, makes misleading claims about 5G vendors's development process and presence in China \[Stuff2019\], \[YouTube2019\].
- August 19, 2019: GCSB accepts Vodafone's application to use Nokia equipment in its 5G network \[NZHerald2019\].
- November 19, 2019. Spark selects Nokia as its 5G wireless equipment provider \[Nokia2019\], \[RCR2021\].
- June 26, 2020. 2degrees in deal with Vodafone to expand geographical coverage in New Zealand using Vodafone's cell towers \[Scoop2020\].
- April 13, 2021. 2degrees declares use of Ericsson equipment in its 5G network \[NZHerald2021\].
- October 2021. Good 5G consumer experience reported for Vodafone, Spark \[OpenSignal2021\]. 

### Lessons from New Zealand's timeline
By the fourth quarter of 2021, all three of Vodafone, Spark and 2degrees seem to have accepted GCSB's decision on Huawei.
Vodafone and Spark have rolled out 5G in New Zealand and their networks' performance appears to be satisfactory to customers.
2degrees has not fully rolled out a 5G network (in January 2022) - partially due to financial constraints, including previous reliance on Huawei vendor financing.

## Andrew Bowater's claims

### 2019 Statements
"We are ... 100% owned by our own staff."

"GCHQ has never never found any evidence of deliberate wrong doing by Huawei nor any state inteference from China or any suggestion of counter-espionage..."

"... everything we do in the UK and New Zealand apart looking at all source code and nothing has been found"

"... [Nokia, Ericsson] manufacture and do their product development in China like us, the key difference being that their headquarters are in Europe"

"... The core is critical and it's only through the core that you could manipulate a network..."

"America no longer had any skin in the [wireless telecom] market... Nortel, Sun and the other competitors .... had all disappeared..."
