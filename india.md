# New military tensions add to prior mistrust in India
Chinese vendors Huawei and ZTE have long supplied leading Indian mobile operators with telecom equipment.
Over the period of Huawei's deployment in Indian mobile networks, government officials documented at least two Huawei espionage operations.
Publicly reported espionage cases against Huawei in other countries added fuel to Indian officials' suspicions of Huawei.
With increasing Chinese military activity by China on the border with India and a declining opinion of China in the broader public, the Indian government appears to have signalled its telecom operators to build 5G networks without equipment from either Chinese vendor.

## Mobile operators in India
India has four major mobile operators - Jio (Reliance), Airtel (Bharti), Vi (Vodaphone Idea) and BSNL (Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited - a stated owned enterprise) \[1\].
Jio does not use telecom equipment from Huawei or ZTE but the other three companies do.
BSNL uses equipment from both Huawei and ZTE, whereas Airtel and Vi use equipment from Huawei for their 2G/3G/4G networks \[2\], \[3\].
