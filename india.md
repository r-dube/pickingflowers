# New military tensions add to prior mistrust in India
Chinese vendors Huawei and ZTE have long supplied leading Indian mobile operators with telecom equipment.
Over the period of Huawei's deployment in Indian mobile networks, government officials documented at least two Huawei espionage operations.
Publicly reported espionage cases against Huawei in other countries added fuel to Indian officials' suspicions of Huawei.
With increasing Chinese military activity by China on the border with India and a declining opinion of China in the broader public, the Indian government appears to have signalled its telecom operators to build 5G networks without equipment from either Chinese vendor.

## Mobile operators in India
India has four major mobile operators - Jio (Reliance), Airtel (Bharti), Vi (Vodaphone Idea) and BSNL (Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited - a stated owned enterprise) \[1\].
Jio does not use telecom equipment from Huawei or ZTE but the other three companies do.
BSNL uses equipment from both Huawei and ZTE, whereas Airtel and Vi use equipment from Huawei for their 2G/3G/4G networks \[2\], \[3\].

## Huawei's espionage operations
In 2014, Huawei infiltrated BSNL's network impacting the operations of a small number of cell towers.
As per \[4\], Huawei carried out the operation in retaliation for BSNL selecting ZTE as a supplier. 
The intent of the hack - wheter it was to collect information on ZTE or to frame ZTE as an unreliable supplier - is unclear.
However, the incident does make clear Huawei's willingness to go beyond legal avenues in India.

In more recent years, several other countries have publicly attributed espionage activities to Huawei \[4a\].
Indian regulators and decision makers have likely taken notice of news on Huawei in these countries. 

## Chinese military operations in the Himalayas
Indian government officials have long been suspicious of Chinese companies, given tension along the long Himalayan border between India and China.
In 2009, the Indian government temporarily disallowed BSNL from deploying equipment from Chinese vendors in some Indian states.
The government did not trust the Chinese vendors to stay out of Indian affairs or to keep information generated in India out of the hands of the Chinese goverment.
The restriction on BSNL was eventually removed in 2010 \[5\].

While the Himalayan border had been largely quite for several decades, China's expansionism in the area led to several clashes between the Indian and Chinese army starting 2017 and leading into 2021.
Some of these clashes involved loss of life.
In one incident in June 2020, 20 Indian soldiers died in a Chinese ambush in the Ladakh region of India \[3\], \[6\].

The Himalayan clashes forced the Indian government to re-evaluate its relationship with the Chinese government and Chinese companies.
In 2020, the Indian banned 59 Chinese mobile applications from operating in India. 
The list included TikTok and WeChat.
The general idea of the ban was to prevent Chinese propaganda from spreading in India.
The ban also served to signal India's intention to take a harder line on its Chinese policies \[3\].

## Post-COVID public opinion of China 
Some of China's border intrusions in the Himalayas seem to have been timed to take advantage of the spread of COVID-19 in India.
That is, the infilitration was initiated at a time when the Indian government was attempting to contain the spread of COVID-19.

Separately, public opinion on China shifted in India as people realized that China had suppressed information on COVID-19 when the pandemic was in its early phases \[7\], \[8\].
As a result, the vast majority of the Indian population agreed with the ban on Chinese mobile applications and contracts to Chinese companies operating in India \[9\].

## Soft ban
As of this writing, India has not banned Huawei or ZTE from operating in India.
However, the government has signalled its displeasure with the Chinese government, Chinese state directed companies such as Huawei and Chinese state owned enterprises such as ZTE on several occassions. 
As a result, all four of the major mobile operators in India distanced themselves from Huawei and ZTE, at least up to a point \[10\], \[11\], \[12\], \[13\], \[14\].

In May 2021, the Indian government gave permission to four companies - Jio, Airtel, Vi and MTNL (another state owned enterprise with a smaller footprint than BSNL) - to initiate 5G trials.
These four companies could use telecom equipment from Nokia, Ericsson and Samsung along with some other companies.
However, Huawei and ZTE were not named as allowed vendors for the trial.
They were not banned explicitly either.
Regardless, ongoing 5G trials without Huawei and ZTE's participation constitues a de-facto ban on the two companies with Indian mobile operators \[15\].

## Ongoing formalization
The Indian government is in the process of formalizing equipment vendors allowed to provide equipment to Indian telecom operators \[15\].
Thus far, 5G vendors Nokia and Ericsson have been approved via this process.
Cisco and India-based Tejas have also been approved.
Huawei and ZTE appear to have engaged with the India approval process (at least up to a point), but have not been formally approved as allowed vendors \[16\].
