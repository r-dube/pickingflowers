# ... in the U.K.

## Mobile operators in the U.K.
As of 2022, the U.K. has four major mobile operators: O2, EE, Vodafone and Three \[Wiki1].

Back in 2020, O2 was the only operator that did not use Huawei equipment in its mobile network, relying on Nokia and Ericsson instead. 
EE deployed equipment from Huawei, Nokia, and Ericsson
Vodafone used Huawei, Ericsson, Nokia, and Cisco.
Three built its network with Huawei, Nokia, and Samsung
