# About book 1
In book 1, we explore Huawei's involvement in Chinese espionage, information, and surveillance operations.
Huawei has a special in understanding Chinese operations because:
  * It has been involved in intellectual property theft for a long time (at least since 2003). 
  It has also coordinated with Chinese intelligence operations since the late 1990s.
  * The company is of systemic importance to the communist party of China (CCP).
  * Intelligence agencies in some countries such as the U.S. and Canada have tracked and followed Huawei operations for several years, leaving behind some public documentation.

  The idea is to understand the nature and extent of China's operations using Huawei as an example.
