# Huawei assisted espionage in Australia

## Mobile operators in Australia
As of 2022, Australia has three main mobile operators: Telstra, Optus and TPG Telecom \[Wiki1\].

Telstra has the largest penetration of the three operators and uses Ericsson equipment in its 3G, 4G and 5G mobile networks.

Optus is a subsidiary of Singapore Telecom (Singtel). Optus's 3G and 4G mobile networks used equipment from Huawei \[SMH2018\].

TPG Telecom came about with the merger of Vodafone Hutchison Australia (VHA) and TPG - an internet service provider that also ran a 4G mobile network. VHA used equipment from Huawei in its 3G and 4G mobile networks, in addition to Nokia and Ericsson equipment for other parts of the same network \[Wiki1\], \[SMH2018\].

## Huawei's role in 2012 espionage incident
As per \[Bloomberg2021\], Chinese agents (seemingly) worked with technical employees of Huawei to install an un-authorized software update on Huawei equipment Optus's network.
Subsequently, this software update functioned as a wiretap - it recorded data being transmitted over Optus's network and sent the data to servers in China. 
Finally, after a few days of operation, the un-authorized software update deleted the wiretap code.

The incident is reported to have occurred in early 2012.
Given that Optus only started using Huawei equipment in March 2012, the incident ocurred very early in Optus's 4G network rollout.
It is possible that Chinese intelligence agents wanted to use the cover of (chaotic) bootstrapping activity for a new network to carry out their operation.

The operation also appears to have been a proof-of-concept - in principle the wiretap code could have remained in place for multiple weeks or months, but at increasing risk of detection.
It is likely that Chinese intelligence agents were merely validating that they had an adequate understading of and access to Huawei's equipment to conduct a covert wiretap.
