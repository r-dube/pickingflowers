# Assisting espionage in Australia
Huawei has been operating in Australia since 2004, providing networking and wireless equipment to telecom operators.
While Huawei had grand ambitions of achieving deeper penetration into Australian telecom operators, a Huawei-assisted espionage incident stopped that ambition.
In 2018, the Australian Govt. prevented Huawei from participating in Australia's 5G network build-out.
Since then, Huawei's business in Australia has been declining.

## Mobile operators in Australia
As of 2022, Australia had three leading mobile operators: Telstra, Optus, and TPG Telecom \[Wiki1\].

Telstra has the largest penetration of the three operators and uses Ericsson equipment in its 3G, 4G, and 5G mobile networks.

Optus is a subsidiary of Singapore Telecom (Singtel). Optus's 3G and 4G mobile networks used equipment from Huawei \[SMH2018\].

TPG Telecom came about with the merger of Vodafone Hutchison Australia (VHA) and TPG - an internet service provider that also ran a 4G mobile network. VHA used equipment from Huawei in its 2G, 3G, and 4G mobile networks, in addition to Nokia and Ericsson equipment for other parts (core) of the same network \[Wiki1\], \[SMH2018\].

## Huawei's role in the 2012 espionage incident
As per \[Bloomberg2021\], Chinese agents worked with technical employees of Huawei to install an unauthorized software update on Huawei equipment in Optus's network.
Subsequently, this software update functioned as a wiretap - it recorded data being transmitted over Optus's network and sent the data to servers in China. 
Finally, after a few days of operation, the unauthorized software update deleted itself.

The incident is reported to have occurred in early 2012.
Given that Optus only started using Huawei equipment in March 2012, the incident occurred very early in Optus's 4G network rollout.
Chinese intelligence agents may have wanted to use the cover of the (chaotic) bootstrapping activity for a new network to carry out their operation.

The operation also appears to have been a proof of concept. In principle, the wiretap code could have remained in place for multiple weeks or months, but at increasing risk of detection by Australian Intelligence services or Optus's system administrators.
Likely, Chinese intelligence agents were merely validating that they had an adequate understanding of and access to Huawei's equipment to conduct a covert wiretap.

## Executive level permission for espionage?
It is unclear from the public reporting if Huawei executives knew of the 2012 espionage operation, opposed the operation, or actively sanctioned it.
Regardless, the Chinese government's access to the Huawei personnel that mattered for the operation - technical people that could facilitate the unauthorized update - is clear.

Note that the 2012 operation happened before the Chinese National Intelligence Law went into effect (in 2017).
The law was not needed by Chinese intelligence agents to obtain cooperation from Huawei personnel.
Effectively, the National Intelligence Law seems to have formalized the access that Chinese intelligence already had to Huawei (and other Chinese companies).
