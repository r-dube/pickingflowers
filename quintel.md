# Huawei files patent using Quintel intellectual property
Quintel Tehcnology Ltd. is a U.S. and U.K. based supplier of antenna technology.
This technology improves reception between cell phones and antennas on cell towers.
Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. engaged Quintel in 2009 to acquire its antenna technology.
In reality, Huawei used its engagement with Quintel as a cover to understand Quintel's technology and steal it.

## Luring Quintel with the prosepect of a business deal
In 2009, Huawei expressed interest in Quintell's antenna technology.
Wanting to know more, Huawei excecuted a non disclosure agreement (NDA) with Quintel in September 2009.
This agreement prevented Huawei from using any disclosed technology for its own benefit or to Quintel's disadvantage.
The NDA enabled Quintel to have technological discussions with Huawei, while protecting its intellectual property (atleast in principle).

Subsequently, Quintel made a detailed presentation of its technology to Huawei.
After the presentation, several Huawei engineers requested additional detail from Quintel on its technology.
Assuming that it was protected by the NDA, Quintel answered these technical questions.

Zhengxiang Ma, a Huawei employee, coordinated the engagement between Huawei and Quintel.
As the technical exchange progressed, Ma repeatedly urged Quintel to be patient in its dealings with Huawei.

Ultimately, the technical decisions did not lead to a business arrangement and Quintel disengaged with Huawei.

## Filing a patent using Quintel's ideas
On October 30, 2009, while the discussions with Quintel were ongoing, Ma filed a provisional patent using ideas from Quintel's presentation and the subsequent technical exchange with Huawei's engineers.
The thought was that if Huawei filed the provisional patent application ahead of Quintel, it would establish priority with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) on Quintel's technology.

On October 29, 2010, Ma filed a patent application with the USPTO as a followup to the provisional application in 2009.
This patent application was approved by the USPTO on November 18, 2014 and patent number 8,891,647 was granted to Ma.
Ma assigned the patent to Huawei.

## Quintel discovers the theft
Quintel remained unaware of Ma's patent applications till March 2015.
The matter came to light only when Quintel's own patent application in Europe was rejected.
The European Patent Agency cited Huawei's U.S. patent as prior art in rejecting Quintel's application.
