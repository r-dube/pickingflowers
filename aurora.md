# Large scale intrusion into private U.S. corporations
In 2009, Chinese government hackers already had a large scale cyber espionage operation underway in multiple countries with targets such as the Tibetan government in exile \[1\]. 
However, penetrating U.S. intelligence operations was likely proving harder.
As an alternative, the Chinese hackers penetrated multiple private (non-state) U.S. corporations to aid their espionage and counter-espionage efforts.
Along the way, they also stole intellectual property from these corporations. 
These near simultaneous intrusions into U.S. corporations came to be known as Operation Aurora \[2\].

## Chinese counter-espionage via Google
Chinese spies in the U.S. sometimes use Gmail.
U.S. intelligence services track these Chinese spies and in some cases have gotten court orders to access the spies' information at Google.

Google had built an internal portal to service court-ordered requests for information on the (alleged) spy accounts from the U.S. intelligence services.
The Chinese govenment wanted to known which Gmail accounts were under surveillance - so that the government could figure out which of its spies had been discovered.

Obviously, such information could be gotten by breaking into the U.S. intelligence services.
However, at the time, it was easier to break into a company such as Google to obtain this information.

The Chinese attackers orchestrated their break into Google by first identifying and then breaking into the accounts of Chinese nationals who communicated with Google's Chinese employees.
That is, the attackers first broke into the lightly defended accounts of Google China's employees' friends and family.

The attackers had prepared a Windows exploit that used an as yet unknown vulnerability (zero day) in Microsoft's Internet Explorer.
This exploit would download spyware onto a user's computer if the user clicked a malicious link using Internet Explorer.
The Chinese attackers used the compromised friends and family accounts to send the malicious link inside phishing messages to Google's Chinese employees.

Those employees that clicked on the malicious links using their work computers had their computers compromised.
The attackers used these computers to access the rest of Google's network.
In particular, the Chinese attackers accessed the Google internal portal to identify the Chinese spies on U.S. intelligence agencies' radar.

## Surveilling Chinese dissidents and human rights activists
Many Chinese dissidents and minority ethnic group human rights activists use Google services such as Gmail.
To access some of these services from China, one has to first use a virtual privant network (VPN) to get around Chinese censorship and surveillance.
The accounts of these dissidents and activists could also be accessed using Google's internal portal.

As part of Operation Aurora, the Chinese attackers, accessed the accounts of several dissidents and activists.
One of these dissidents was Ai Weiwei - a well known artisit living in China - who maintained two gmail accounts.

The information gathered from Ai's account was subsequently used to harrass him with tax violations.
In November 2010, Ai was placed under house arrest. 
Then in 2011 Ai was jailed and his passport seized. 
Worn down by the Chinese government, Ai left China in 2015 - a result that the Chinese goverment wanted as it would be far more difficult for Ai to challenge the government from outside China.

## Stealing source code
At the time of the Aurora attacks, most companies that developed software configured their source control managament (SCM) systems for ease of use by their software developers.
Typically, there was no extra security protecting the SCM system and often source code was transmitted un-encrypted between the developers computer and the SCM system.
Google was one of these companies.

The Chinese attackers stole Google's source code.
However, Google has not disclosed how much source code was stolen and for which products.

The attackers could use the source code in at least three ways.
First, they could examing the source code to aid future attacks on Google or Google's users.
Second, they could inject their own code into Google's to create a vulnerability in Google's services that would not otherwise exist.
Third, they could share the source code with Google's Chinese competitors such as Baidu.
Note that Baidu is know to have collaborated with the Chinese government on attacks on companies such as Github.
Further, the Chinese government is also known to routinely share trade secrets and Intellectual property with Chinese corporations.
