# Cisco's code in Huawei's products

Huawei, a Chinese company, has risen to prominence as a networking and telecommunications equipment provider in the 2000s.
Huawei's rise is dotted with intellectural property theft cases.
One of these cases is code (software) theft from Cisco Inc., a U.S. manufacturer of networking equipment.
Huawei acknowledges that it used code from Cisco in its products, but pins the blame for code theft on individidual software engineers acting on their own.

## Huawei accepts some responsibility
In January 2003, Cisco filed a lawsuit against Huawei in the U.S. for stealing code from its IOS operating system that ran on its routers and switches.
As part of the lawsuit, Cisco alleged that Huawei not only stole code, but that Huwaei also copied the IOS command line interface and the IOS documentation related to the stolen code.

In July 2004, Cisco dropped the lawsuit after Huawei acknowledged that it had some Cisco code in its Quidway routers.
As part of the lawsuit process, Huawei removed the offending code from its products and changed its user interface and documentation.
A third party verified that there was no longer any Cisco code in Huawei's Quidway routers.

Huawei claimed that two of its software engineers acted on their own without a corporate mandate to copy Cisco's code. 
The Huawei engineers are alleged to have received the Cisco code for VRRP from an unidentified source and proceeded to incorporate the code into a Quidway software release.

## Cisco's competition with 3COM muddies the waters
Cisco's case against Huawei was a little muddied by its near simulatenous effort to buy Huawei. 
At the time of the lawsuit, Cisco competed with 3COM Inc. in some severals sub-sgements of the networking industry.
3COM had launched a joint venture with Huawei called Future Wei.
3COM rose to Huawei's defense during the lawsuit, even though it was not a party to the lawusit, as restrictrions on the sale of Huawei's products would hurt 3COM's business.
In similar vein, if Cisco bought out Huawei, it would gain an advantage against 3COM.
Cisco only proceeded with the lawsuit when it failed to pursuade Huawei to sell itself to Cisco.

## Huawei's corporate culture promotes intellectual property theft
Contrary to its claims during the Cisco lawsuit, Huwaei does seem to have a corporate culture of extracting other corporations' intellectualy property, by "any means neccessary."
Roughly at the same time as the Huawei's software engineers were copying Cisco's code, Huwaei was engaged in a multi-year project to extract intellectual property from Canada's Nortel Networks.
Years later, the U.S. federal government indicted Huawei for stealing intellectual property from T-mobile, a U.S. telecom carrier.

## Huawei is indirectly owned by the CCP.
