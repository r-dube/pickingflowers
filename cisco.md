# Cisco's code in Huawei's products

Huawei, a Chinese company, has risen to prominence as a networking and telecommunications equipment provider in the 2000s.
Huawei's rise is dotted with intellectural property theft cases.
One of these cases is code (software) theft from Cisco Inc., a U.S. manufacturer of networking equipment.
Huawei acknowledges that it used code from Cisco in its products, but pins the blame for code theft on individidual software engineers acting on their own.

## Huawei accepts some responsibility
In January 2003, Cisco filed a lawsuit against Huawei in the U.S. for stealing code from its IOS operating system that ran on its routers and switches.
As part of the lawsuit, Cisco alleged that Huawei not only stole code, but that Huwaei also copied the IOS command line interface and the IOS documentation related to the stolen code.

In July 2004, Cisco dropped the lawsuit after Huawei acknowledged that it had some Cisco code in its Quidway routers.
As part of the lawsuit process, Huawei removed the offending code from its products and changed its user interface and documentation.
A third party verified that there was no longer any Cisco code in Huawei's Quidway routers.

Huawei claimed that two of its software engineers acted on their own without a corporate mandate to copy Cisco's code. 
The Huawei engineers are alleged to have received the Cisco code for VRRP from an unidentified source and proceeded to incorporate the code into a Quidway software release.
