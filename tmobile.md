# Huawei steals T-mobile's robot technology
T-mobile USA Inc., a U.S. telecom carrier, created a robot in 2006 to mimic human use of cell phones.
In 2012 T-mobile used this robot to test Huawei's cell phones for launch on its network.
As it turned out, Huawei's phones were not doing well at T-mobile's tests.
Simultaneously, inspired by T-mobile's technology, Huawei was developing its own robot.
However, Huawei was running into technical challenges in the development of its robot.
To improve performance on T-mobile's tests and to speed up the development of the Huawei robot, Huawei's management authorized its engineers to steal technology from the T-mobile robot.

## T-mobile's robot development
Since 2006, T-mobile had invested significant effort in building its cell phone testing robot.
T-mobile believed that automated testing by the robot reduced cell-phone returns post launch and in the process, gave it an edge over the carriers that it competed with \[1\], \[2\].

Initially, T-mobile restricted the robot's use to T-mobile employees.
However, based on feedback from cell phone vendors, T-mobile eventually allowed a pre-approved list of vendor employees to use the robot.
The vendors' use of the robot was subject to several intellectual property protection rules.
These rules included prohibitions on taking photographs or videos of the robot and reverse engineering the robot.
Huawei's management signed an agreement with T-mobile indicating that its employees would adhere to T-mobile's rules \[2\].
