# Huawei steals T-mobile's robot technology
T-mobile USA Inc., a U.S. telecom carrier, created a robot in 2006 to mimic human use of cell phones.
In 2012 T-mobile used this robot to test Huawei's cell phones for launch on its network.
As it turned out, Huawei's phones were not doing well at T-mobile's tests.
Simultaneously, inspired by T-mobile's technology, Huawei was developing its own robot.
However, Huawei was running into technical challenges in the development of its robot.
To improve performance on T-mobile's tests and to speed up the development of the Huawei robot, Huawei's management authorized its engineers to steal technology from the T-mobile robot.

## T-mobile builds a robot
Since 2006, T-mobile had invested significant effort in building its cell phone testing robot.
T-mobile believed that automated testing by the robot reduced cell-phone returns post launch and in the process, gave it an edge over the carriers that it competed with \[1\], \[2\].

Initially, T-mobile restricted the robot's use to T-mobile employees.
However, based on feedback from cell phone vendors, T-mobile eventually allowed a pre-approved list of vendor employees to use the robot.
The vendors' use of the robot was subject to several intellectual property protection rules.
These rules included prohibitions on taking photographs or videos of the robot and reverse engineering the robot.
Huawei's management signed an agreement with T-mobile indicating that its employees would adhere to T-mobile's rules \[2\], \[3\]. 

## Huawei management directs corporate espionage
In 2012, Huawei was attempting to establish a market for its products on T-mobile's network. Facing poor results in T-mobile's robot-assisted tests and technical difficulties in its internal testing robot development project, Huawei's management first asked T-mobile for a license to the robot technology. 
T-mobile viewed the robot technology as a competitive advantage.
In particular, it did not want to help cell phone vendors produce products that worked as well on competing network as they did on T-mobile's network.
T-mobile declined to license the technology, not just to Huawei, but to other cell phone vendors as well \[2\].

Once Huawei's management realized that T-mobile was not going to license the robot technology, it directed specific employees with access to the T-mobile robot take photographs, videos and measurements of various robot parts in an attempt to reverse-engineer the robot.
At one point in May 2013, a Huawei employee surreptiously removed a mechanical arm from the robot to take it out of T-mobile's premises for photography and measurement.
At another point, another Huawei employee with access to the robot, enabled another Huawei employee to gain unauthorized access to the robot.
All these actions violated Huawei's agreement with T-mobile that gave Huawei employees access to the robot for testing in exchange for staying away for reverse engineering \[2\]

## Huawei disavows employees
After the removal of the robot arm, T-mobile tightened restrictions on Huawei personnel's access to the robot lab.
Further, T-mobile formally complained about the actions of Huawei's employees to Huawei's managment.
In an effort to save face, Huawei's management portrayed the actions of its employees as the unsactioned efforts of misguided individuals.
Huawei's management eventually claimed that two of the employees involved in the the effort to steal T-mobile's intellectual property had violated company policy.
The two employees were termianted by Huawei in August 2013 \[2\].

## Huawei impedes investigation
As T-mobile wisened up to Huawei's actions and complained to Huawei's management, Huawei attempted to cover its tracks.
Huawei produced an "investigation report" in which it claimed that two of its employees (the ones who were eventually terminated) had acted on their own and understated that information that the two employees had managed to collect from T-mobile

Huawei eventually made the two employees available for interviews with T-mobile.
However, Huawei coached the engineers to make false and misleading statements to T-mobile to obfuscate the involvement of other Huawei personnel, including those in management roles \[2\].

## Huawei loses civil case
In September 2014, T-mobile filed a civil lawsuit against Huawei.
Amongst other things, T-mobile alleged a breach of contract by Huawei \[4\].

T-mobile partially won the case against Huawei in 2019 - a jury awarded it $4.8M U.S. dollars for Huawei's breach of contract.
However, T-mobile was unable to convince the jury of more serious charges that would have required the jury to agree that Huawei's actions were "willful and malicious".
Had T-mobile succeeded more fully in their lawsuit, Huawei would have had to pay much higher penalties.
