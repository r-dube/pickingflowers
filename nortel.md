# Chinese military infiltrates Nortel
In the early 1980s, China set out on a path to modernize its infrastructure, including its telecommunication networks. 
Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. and ZTE Corp. came into being to support the network modernization endeavor. 
However, as telecommunications and networking technologies evolved, China found that its local technology providers, did not have the knowhow to build modern equipment all on their own.
It appears, that the Chinese Government resorted to using its military to steal intellectual property from more advanced foreign corporations. 
The Chinese military subsequently provided the stolen intellectual to local companies. 
One example was the theft of Nortel Network's intellectual property to aid Huawei's product and business development. 

## Telecommunications and networking in the 1990s
In the 1990s Telecommunications and networking were undergoing multiple changes.
First, Transmission Control Protocol / Intenet Protocol (TCP/IP) based data networks were replacing portions of the voice network.
Second, fiber-based physical connections were replacing copper-wire based connections.
Third, cell phones were becoming for ordinary businesses and individuals.

Several commmercial telecom equipment manufacturers, including Cisco Systems, Nortel Networks, Lucent Technologies, Alcatel S.A., Ericcson and Nokia Corp. participated in the industry segment.
Most of these companies had spent years or decades incrementally developing their technology stack.
Some, such as Cisco were  known for their data switching and routing equipment.
Others such as Nortel and Lucent were know for their voice, wireless and optical technologies.

## Nortel in the 1990s
Nortel in the 1990s was a powerhouse telecom and networking equipment vendor.
It was a prominent supplier of voice products including Private Branch eXchange (PBX).
Nortel was also the domininant supplier of high-speed optical networks and a global leader in wireless technology.
Finally, through the acquisiton of Bay Networks, Nortel had a portfolio of data networking products as well.

In North America, Nortel compteted intensely with both Lucent and Cisco.
