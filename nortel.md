# Chinese military infiltrates Nortel
In the early 1980s, China set out on a path to modernize its infrastructure, including its telecommunication networks. 
Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. and ZTE Corp. came into being to support the network modernization endeavor. 
However, as telecommunications and networking technologies evolved, China found that its local technology providers, did not have the knowhow to build modern equipment all on their own.
It appears, that the Chinese Government resorted to using its military to steal intellectual property from more advanced foreign corporations. 
The Chinese military subsequently provided the stolen intellectual to local companies. 
One example was the theft of Nortel Network's intellectual property to aid Huawei's product and business development.
