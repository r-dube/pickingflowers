# About this book
Whatever it happens to be, the latest widely reported cyber attack takes the oxygen out of conversations on information security. 
Most information security practitioners are unable to track attacks by country of origin over multiple quarters or years. 
Thus, the task of collating and interpreting attacks by country of origin falls to book and book-length-report writers. 
Books by attack country exist, but in the English language, they tend to focus on Russia.
None seem to be available on China, despite its growing attack activity. 
This book is an attempt to fill that gap on China.

The title of this book is inspired by a report on China's military (People's Liberation Army - PLA) infilitration of international research universities. 
The title of the report - *Picking Flowers Making Honey*<sup>[1](#aspi20181030)</sup> - comes from a phrase that the PLA uses (picking flowers in foreign lands to make honey in China) to describe its university espionage program.
